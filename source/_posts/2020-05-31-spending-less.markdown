There are four popular ways of growing your wealth:

1. Spending less
2. Investing wisely
3. Earning more
4. Getting lucky

They all differ in their effectiveness and difficulty of implementation.

1. Spending less:  the easiest of all
2. Investing wisely: difficult; requires expertise 
3. Earning more: not easy, but the most effective
4. Getting lucky: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

"Spending less" is the low hanging fruit out of the four. It's directly tied to human behavior, and we can apply techniques backed by research to help us spend less.

## The Science
The [Fogg Behavior Model](https://www.behaviormodel.org/) states that behavior occurs at the intersection of 3 things:

1. *Trigger*. A prompt for an action
2. *Motivation* to do the action
3. *Ability* to perform the action

Some examples:

* Upon encountering a bug 🐞 in the Linux OS (_prompt_), I may have a strong desire (_motivation_) to submit a patch to the Linux kernel, but it's well beyond my _ability_ to do so. I will not do it. 😅
* After brushing my teeth in the morning (_prompt_), I can easily do 20 pushups (_ability_). But. I. Just. Want. My. Coffee. ☕ (_motivation_)
* I see a bowl of cashews and dates on the dinner table (_prompt_). I love dates (_motivation_). I will pick them up and eat (_ability_)

**To summarise:** 

When we're prompted to act, if we have the _ability_ to do it **and** high enough a _motivation_ to do it, we do it. If either is lacking, we don't.

Spending falls in this same model. 

* You're on Twitter, someone tweets a picture of something enticing you've been thinking buying, you go to Amazon and buy it with a few clicks. ✅
* A friend tells you about an excellent book they're reading; you go to Goodreads, find the reviews and descriptions. You're convinced. You buy. ✅
* You hear about a great electric bike that looks fabulous and seems like a perfect fit for you. You notice the price is way out of your budget. You don't buy it. 🚫

So how do we use what we learned above? Often the easiest way is to remove the prompts. It works like a charm. But it's not always possible. The prompts _will_ occur, and we will have to rely on reduced motivation and reduced ability to prevent the action.

## A strategy for minimizing spending

* Figure out a reasonable expenditure cap for your household, say ₹ X0,000/month 💸
* This includes all outgoing: rents, EMIs, groceries, eat-outs, credit card payments, shopping, what have you. 🏠 🛍️ 🥘 (Review this figure twice a year)
* Dedicate an account for these expenses. Each month, put this amount there. Direct ALL YOUR SPENDING to _this_ account. _All._ 🔑
* When you run out of money in this account, DO NOT SPEND. 🙅🏼‍♂️ 🚫
* If you use credit cards, you can only spend what you have in THIS ACCOUNT. No more. No converting into EMIs. 💳
* Do not deviate far from your personality. e.g., I love occasional shopping and splurging, and so I account for it. Moderation is key. Without it, you will fall off the wagon quickly. ✋🏼 🛑
* If you can, rely on spouses, partners, parents, children for accountability. Return the favor and be accountable for them. 👪
* Account for annual, non-monthly, and aperiodic expenses. Insurance policies, vacations, school fees, furniture, laptops, what have you.  🎒 🏖 🏔️ 💻
* Distribute the amount monthly. Put it in liquid funds (consult experts for this) connected to the same spending account. 💰
* Direct ALL THOSE EXPENSES to _this_ account. _All._ 🔑
* Seeding/overdraft: Sometimes significant expenses come before you've accrued enough in the expense account. Have an overdraft margin for it and treat it as a loan to yourself. 
* A reasonable limit allows you to spend just enough to have a happy lifestyle and yet limits spending. ⚖️

## Parting thoughts

We accepted that spending prompts _will_ occur. By decreasing our ability to spend we've pushed the prompt from action zone to no action zone.

Relying on motivation alone is a strategy fraught with peril. By gaming ability and prompts, you can prevent bad behavior or encourage good behavior. Spending less is just one tiny application of this powerful technique.
